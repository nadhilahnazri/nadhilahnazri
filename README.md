## Hi there 👋
I am one of those people who want to do everything and master every skill, currently my best abilities are
- 🐍 python
- 🕹️ tetris

Going through the [GitHub Skills page](http://skills.github.com) purely for the sake of having fun. Please assume I am an expert despite doing beginner courses, it's definitely not because I still struggle with git \*cough\*
